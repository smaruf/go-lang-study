### Characteristics:

| Characteristic | Details |
| :-- | :-- |
| Maximum Speed | Mach 3.2 (approximately 2,200 mph or 3,540 km/h) |
| Cruise Speed | Typically around Mach 3.0 |
| Operational Ceiling | Up to 85,000 feet (25,900 meters) |
| Typical Operating Altitude | Between 75,000 and 85,000 feet during reconnaissance missions |
| Thermal Limits | Surface temperatures could reach up to 600°F (316°C) during flight |
| Engine Type | Pratt & Whitney J58, functioning as both turbojet and ramjet above Mach 2 |
| Pressure Suits | Required for pilots due to extreme altitudes similar to space conditions |
| Air Inlet Controls | Movable shock cones (spikes) to manage air intake and optimize engine performance across speeds and altitudes |
| Flight Dynamics | High-speed stability, limited agility at low speeds, large turning radius at high speeds |
| Hydraulic Cooling | Uses JP-7 fuel as a coolant for hydraulic systems, avionics, and also as a heat sink |
| Fuel Consumption | High rate of consumption, particularly at higher speeds; could burn over 5,600 gallons (21,200 liters) per hour |
| Surface Heating | Primarily due to air friction at high speeds, impacting wing edges, engine nacelles, and cockpit canopy |
| Engine Performance | Unique capability to switch from turbojet to ramjet mode, allowing efficient operation across various altitudes |
