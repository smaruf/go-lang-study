# Concurrency Examples

This directory contains comprehensive examples of Go's concurrency features and patterns.

## Examples

### Worker Pool Pattern (`worker_pool.go`)

A production-ready implementation of the worker pool pattern demonstrating:

- **Context-based cancellation**: Graceful shutdown and timeout handling
- **Structured concurrency**: Proper goroutine lifecycle management
- **Result processing**: Collecting and processing results from workers
- **Error handling**: Handling job failures and timeouts
- **Monitoring**: Logging and metrics for observability

**Features:**
- Configurable number of workers
- Job queuing with buffered channels
- Graceful shutdown with context cancellation
- Result collection and processing
- Comprehensive logging

**Usage:**
```bash
go run worker_pool.go
```

**Key Concepts:**
- Goroutines and channels
- Context package for cancellation
- sync.WaitGroup for coordination
- Channel-based communication
- Structured error handling

## Running the Examples

```bash
# Run the worker pool example
cd concurrency
go run worker_pool.go

# Test with race detection
go run -race worker_pool.go
```

## Learning Objectives

After studying these examples, you'll understand:

1. **Goroutine Management**: How to create, manage, and coordinate goroutines
2. **Channel Communication**: Using channels for inter-goroutine communication
3. **Context Usage**: Implementing cancellation and timeout patterns
4. **Synchronization**: Coordinating concurrent operations with WaitGroup
5. **Error Handling**: Managing errors in concurrent environments
6. **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup and resource management
7. **Observability**: Adding logging and monitoring to concurrent code

## Best Practices Demonstrated

- Always use context for cancellation and timeouts
- Implement graceful shutdown patterns
- Use buffered channels appropriately to prevent deadlocks
- Handle panics in goroutines to prevent crashes
- Implement proper resource cleanup
- Add observability through structured logging
- Use sync.WaitGroup for coordination
- Avoid shared state when possible; use channels for communication

## Common Patterns

1. **Fan-out/Fan-in**: Distributing work to multiple workers and collecting results
2. **Worker Pool**: Fixed number of workers processing jobs from a queue
3. **Pipeline**: Chaining processing stages with channels
4. **Rate Limiting**: Controlling the rate of operations
5. **Circuit Breaker**: Preventing cascade failures in distributed systems
